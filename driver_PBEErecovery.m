% This script facilitates the performance based functional recovery and
% reoccupancy assessment of a single building for a single intensity level

% Input data consists of building model info and simulated component-level
% damage and conesequence data for a suite of realizations, likely assessed
% as part of a FEMA P-58 analysis. Inputs are read in as matlab variables
% direclty from matlab data files.

% Output data is saved to a specified outputs directory and is saved into a
% single matlab variable as at matlab data file.
